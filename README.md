# FirstGeneticAlgorithm
A basic genetic algorithm with a solution being a binary number represented as a list. Ex [0, 1, 0, 1]

This is my first try at creating a genetic algorithm after researching them. The structure of the code is pretty bad as I was and still am learning more about genetic algorithms.
