# FirstGeneticAlgorithm
A basic genetic algorithm with a solution being a binary number represented as a list. Ex. [0, 1, 0, 1]

This is my first try at creating a genetic algorithm after researching them. The structure of the code is pretty bad as I wrote it admidst learning and frequently changed and tested different variations.
